Python Chess Readme File

	Short Description:

	Python Chess is my own implementation of the ancient game of chess - except that this time it’s built on Python and playable on your own computer! Two players can play against one another in a one-on-one simulation that follows the same rules as the classic game.

	How to Run:

	All of the image files should be in the same directory as the Python script itself. Once the Python script is opened, simply by double-clicking it, the game will start. Follow the instructions on the main menu and get to playing!

	Installing Libraries:

	No external libraries need to be installed to play this game - it was al done in TKinter.

	Shortcut Commands:

	No shortcut commands are included as it is quite simple to move all of the chess pieces and get them into many different scenarios and configurations in a short amount of time. Trying to use multiple shortcut commands may have made this process more time-consuming then just trying the game. The game can always be reset by pressing the ‘r’ key.
